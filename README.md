The Whirlpool Galaxy Mega Empire, in its endeavor to expand imperialistic influence across the Milky Way Galactic Neighborhood, sparked a profound galactic conflict in the region. The civilizations of Andromeda and Triangulum strongly disapproved of the intrusion by external forces and united to support Deus Sentis in safeguarding their home territory. Despite the challenges posed by the vast distances involved, delayed reinforcements from other galaxies gradually arrived.

Deus Sentis successfully repelled the Whirlpool invaders, confining them within their enslaved borders, albeit at the cost of significant damage that proved irreversible for their own species. The remnants of their civilization left behind centralized computer systems, still operational through solar power.

During the Astralis-class megaship expedition's survey, the final destination led them to the intergalactic Transmitter constructed by Deus Sentis, comparable in size to Pluto. The transmitter's activation, facilitated by the compressed computer installed on the megaships' quantum computer, enabled remote access via handheld devices. It began broadcasting messages to the galactic alliance, signaling the resurgence of the Milky Way.

However, Deus Sentis had severed all connections between the Milky Way and other galaxies. In response, the Whirlpool Empire linked their network to a local rogue dwarf galaxy, aiming to expedite their assault on the Milky Way. This looming threat places humanity in a one-on-one confrontation against a second attempt by a stellar empire armed with Deus Sentis technologies. Hope lies in seeking assistance from nearby galaxies, with Andromeda poised to deploy forces swiftly, having perfected their FTL technologies over 64 million years and modernized by Deus Sentis.
