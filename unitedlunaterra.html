        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Earth was dying, with each passing year our blue planet, Earth, was becoming less habitable for humanity, in certain regions events frequency was increasing, the soil which was feeding us wasn’t capable of giving us food anymore. Catastrophic heat was rising, Middle East became hell on Earth, people from Asias were migrating because of dying soil. Goverments of Earth, Collectively agreed for own safety unite under one Government, United Nations.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">After Solar System Colonisation Era, When humans settled on Moon, Mars and Venus. United Nations was renamed to United Terra, Representatives of Earth-Moon System. UT decided to move their headquarters to Moon, because of Dying Earth. </h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">In Current Year United Terra holds largest amount of Fleet in Solar System, Their Variant of Jackson Class Propulsive Engine allowed them to compete with planets like Martian Technocratic Republic and Venusian Congress. Certain areas on Earth managed to survive, Forests are still blooming there, and Soil provide largest farms out there. </h3>

Interstellar. Invented by Monte Willson, The Luna-Class FTL Engines capable acceleration of 1,200 C. High Frequency Shields reverse engineered from Venusian alien ship, is able to endure FTL travel which protects Kepler-class Cruisers from Time Dilation and fatal destruction of ship and laws of physics which can be caused by mechanical object traveling faster than light. Some Lunarians think the Venusian alien ship was a gift from Gods themselves to humanity, scientific community called the aliens of the fallen ship as “Deus Sentis” . FTL travellers experience High G overloads and are not capable of travels to stars farther than 15 light years. Humans during travel are hibernated in </h3>
