    <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Proxima Centauri b is an exoplanet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest known star to the Sun. It is located in the Alpha Centauri star system, which is approximately 4.24 light-years away from Earth. Discovered in 2016, Proxima Centauri b is considered a potentially habitable exoplanet, as it resides in the star's habitable zone where conditions might allow for the existence of liquid water. However, various factors, such as the star's variable activity and the planet's unknown atmosphere, make its potential habitability uncertain. Proxima Centauri b has been the subject of ongoing scientific study to better understand its properties and potential for life.
    <br> Proxima has consistently captivated the attention of scientists due to its proximity, emerging as the primary focal point in the quest for extraterrestrial life. As humanity began to unravel the mysteries of Venusian alien ship technologies, Proxima Centauri was designated as the paramount target for the inaugural expedition for testing FAster-Than-Light Technologies

    <h3 id="infoboxh3">After Colonisation:</h3>
    <h3 id="infoboxdesc"> Following the successful FTL test of the initial Test-Object ID 1 model and the identification of its flaws and mistakes, a second model was meticulously perfected and assembled. The inaugural expedition took place aboard the Kepler-Class Interstellar Cruiser Model 2, affectionately nicknamed "initium" (Latin for "Beginning"). This marked a significant milestone in human history
    <br>as it signaled the first instance of humans venturing beyond the confines of the Solar System toward a neighboring star—Proxima B, to be precise. The expedition comprised 52 crew members, led by the experienced ULT Navy jet pilot, Mark Jonathan Cooper.
    <br>
        <br> As the Second Kepler-Class ventured beyond the confines of the Solar System, the crew found themselves in a state of relative isolation, grappling with significant communication delays resulting from time dilation. The MK2, equipped comprehensively for the establishment of an initial small colony, marked a historic moment for humanity. This colony, named Novus Genesis, symbolized a fresh start in human history.
    <br>Located near the equator of the planet, Novus Genesis centered its development around a vital water reservoir named Saviour Lake. The lake contained saline water essential for the colony's filtration needs. In this distant and solitary location, the colony existed in complete isolation, a testament to the pioneering spirit of the human endeavor.</h3>

    <h3 id="infoboxh3">Current Age:</h3>
    <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Proxima Centauri B stands as the epitome of colonial advancement in the current era, with Novus Genesis emerging as the largest and most developed independent city within the stellar neighborhood. Boasting a thriving population exceeding 750,000 people, the city has become a beacon of progress.
    <br> A significant contributor to this progress is the mass production of ULT Type-8 Asteroid miners. These advanced machines play a crucial role in mining exotic metals from Proxima Centauri C Rings, further fueling the economic and technological growth of the colony. In a strategic move, the United LunaTerra Bans Centauri Province embracing the invitation from the Settled Exoplanets Defence Treaty (SEDT) to join the independent Exoplanets Alliance. Joining SEDT would move their borders even closer to Solar System. Proxima Centauri B population en masse consist of Workers and Miners at most, Civilian population mostly migrated to Teegarden's Star C <br> * Settled Exoplanets Defence Treaty is recognised Hostile group in Solar System</h3>
