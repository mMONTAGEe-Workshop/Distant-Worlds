        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Mars, once being second colony of Earth, declared it’s own independence after extracting viable resources from Asteroid Belt, Dependancy on Terra was decreasing with each passing Sol, Their Jackson Class Propulsion Engines Invention were huge step towards becoming independent, Mars had greatest minds competing with Terra for creating new generation of normal cruise engines. Robert Jackson, lead of engineering and innovation of Martian Technate, alongside Jack Florence, Engine was based on Venusian Alien Ships main propulsive engines, The Ship’s engines are capable of deforming space and time to accelerate itself forward, an Alcubierre Engine one would call, but anything higher than 2% of engine power nothing could protect the destructive G’s ship would experience.  Humans across entire system still question apperanace of alien technology in Solar System. Martians firmly share opinion with Venusians that Aliens were gathering information about solar system during era when Venus and Mars were habitable Terras unlike molten Earth of that time. Terranians believe the ship carried battle loss due to its observed damages and escaped to Habitable Venus.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Alien Technology research granted Mars to become second largest Fleet manufacturer after Ceres Shipyard. Their Battle Ships are unmatched across entire system, MTR Juggernaut is their newest and strongest ship ever manufactured in Solar System. Their Science Vessels are shadowed by Terran Kepler-Class Cruiser, with their engine only capable accelerating twice less, 620 C.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Mars Cities are the largest in Solar System, they won their spot after catastrophic events of Dying Earth destroying most of what humanity has built through the history. Grande Olimp (Great Olympus) City surrounding mountain Olympus became capital city of MTR, which spans across entire mountain encircling it.</h3>
