                <h3 id="infoboxdesc"> <i class="bi bi-info-lg"></i> Description: <br> Vishapakar, translating to Dragon Stone, is the renamed exoplanet orbiting Barnard's Star, specifically identified as Barnard's Star b. This celestial body evolved into a thriving settlement following the arrival of an expedition aboard the Kepler-class interstellar cruiser model 2. <br> <br> Vishapakar, despite its name's association with Armenian dragon mythology, presents a starkly contrasting reality as a desert planet shrouded in expansive oceans of saline water. The paradox of its arid surface overlaying substantial saltwater bodies renders the planet habitable in a unique manner. Settlers on Vishapakar have ingeniously adapted to this environment, constructing protective domes and structures to establish thriving communities shielded from the planet's harsh external conditions. Within these artificial habitats, life flourishes, creating a harmonious coexistence between the inhabitants and the desert landscape that defines Vishapakar's intriguing and distinctive character. <br>  </h3>

                <br>
                <h3 id="infoboxdesc">In the local stellar neighborhood, the residents of Vishapakar are widely recognized as a hardworking population oppressed by a dictatorial regime. The propaganda machine actively promotes outdated communist ideologies from Old Terra, exploiting the harsh conditions and unpredictable weather on the planet. Under this narrative, the people are convinced that relentless work is the key to realizing their aspiration of constructing a secure haven for future generations. <br> A commonly echoed sentiment among the Vishapakar populace is encapsulated in their poignant mantra: "Build to keep dark from coming, strong united Barnard's people." This rallying cry reflects their collective determination to overcome adversity through unity and industrious efforts, with the overarching goal of safeguarding their community against the challenges that loom ahead. <br> Vishapakar finds itself in a state of strained relations with the United LunaTerra, rendering any appearance or diplomatic engagement seemingly impossible. In stark contrast, the Martian Technocratic Republic actively supports Vishapakar in their pursuit of peace and a promising future. This stance has, however, faced criticism from the Cetus Federal Republic, which dismisses it as nonsensical. According to critics from Cetus, it seems contradictory for Vishapakar to harbor animosity towards one solar system government while aligning with another, which they perceive as essentially identical in terms of oppressive practices. This contentious perspective highlights the complex and divisive nature of interstellar politics, with different factions voicing divergent opinions on the perceived alliances and conflicts within the solar system.</h3>

                <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Currency: ExoCredits <br> Industry: As a vital participant in the Settled Exoplanets Defence Treaty, Vishapakar boasts a robust economy rooted in mineral extraction from its moons and a flourishing military industry. The TianLong Asteroid serves as the strategic hub for Vishapakar's Colony, functioning as a key military complex. <br> <br> The ShenLong and DiLong Asteroids form an integral part of a cutting-edge scientific complex dedicated to the in-depth exploration of deep space. These asteroids serve as hubs for advanced research and study, focusing on unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos. The scientific endeavors conducted in these celestial bodies contribute significantly to our understanding of the vast expanse of the universe. </h3>

                <h3 id="infoboxdesc"> The inhospitable environment of Barnard's Star b, known as Vishapakar, presently poses insurmountable challenges for sustaining organic life as we understand it today. Despite these harsh conditions, geological studies have unveiled evidence suggesting the past existence of sizable creatures on Vishapakar, although the exact timeframe remains unknown. <br> Fascinatingly, the inhabitants of Vishapakar subscribe to the belief that these ancient life forms were, in fact, dragons that once roamed the planet. This perception adds a mythical and awe-inspiring dimension to the planet's history, as the people of Vishapakar draw connections between the formidable creatures of the past and the formidable challenges they face in the present. The notion of dragons, though rooted in the unknown and speculative, serves as a symbolic representation of resilience and strength in the face of adversity for the people of Vishapakar. </h3>
