        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Earth was dying, with each passing year our blue planet, Earth, was becoming less habitable for humanity, in certain regions events frequency was increasing, the soil which was feeding us wasn’t capable of giving us food anymore. Catastrophic heat was rising, Middle East became hell on Earth, people from Asias were migrating because of dying soil. Goverments of Earth, Collectively agreed for own safety unite under one Government, United Nations.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">After Solar System Colonisation Era, When humans settled on Moon, Mars and Venus. United Nations was renamed to United Terra, Representatives of Earth-Moon System. UT decided to move their headquarters to Moon, because of Dying Earth. </h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">In Current Year United Terra holds largest amount of Fleet in Solar System, Their Variant of Jackson Class Propulsive Engine allowed them to compete with planets like Martian Technocratic Republic and Venusian Congress. Certain areas on Earth managed to survive, Forests are still blooming there, and Soil provide largest farms out there. </h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Alien Artefacts on Venus, One of which was Engine of unknown specifications, United Terra joint with Venusian Congress reverse engineered the engine, which opened humans entire new aspect of space exploration. Interstellar. Invented by Monte Willson, The Luna-Class FTL Engines capable acceleration of 1,200 C. High Frequency Shields reverse engineered from Venusian alien ship, is able to endure FTL travel which protects Kepler-class Cruisers from Time Dilation and fatal destruction of ship and laws of physics which can be caused by mechanical object traveling faster than light. Some Lunarians think the Venusian alien ship was a gift from Gods themselves to humanity, scientific community called the aliens of the fallen ship as “Deus Sentis” . FTL travellers experience High G overloads and are not capable of travels to stars farther than 15 light years. Humans during travel are hibernated in </h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">cryopods. During hibernation human body does not experience huge effects of High G allowing them to endure most of travel.</h3>

        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Mars, once being second colony of Earth, declared it’s own independence after extracting viable resources from Asteroid Belt, Dependancy on Terra was decreasing with each passing Sol, Their Jackson Class Propulsion Engines Invention were huge step towards becoming independent, Mars had greatest minds competing with Terra for creating new generation of normal cruise engines. Robert Jackson, lead of engineering and innovation of Martian Technate, alongside Jack Florence, Engine was based on Venusian Alien Ships main propulsive engines, The Ship’s engines are capable of deforming space and time to accelerate itself forward, an Alcubierre Engine one would call, but anything higher than 2% of engine power nothing could protect the destructive G’s ship would experience.  Humans across entire system still question apperanace of alien technology in Solar System. Martians firmly share opinion with Venusians that Aliens were gathering information about solar system during era when Venus and Mars were habitable Terras unlike molten Earth of that time. Terranians believe the ship carried battle loss due to its observed damages and escaped to Habitable Venus.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Alien Technology research granted Mars to become second largest Fleet manufacturer after Ceres Shipyard. Their Battle Ships are unmatched across entire system, MTR Juggernaut is their newest and strongest ship ever manufactured in Solar System. Their Science Vessels are shadowed by Terran Kepler-Class Cruiser, with their engine only capable accelerating twice less, 620 C.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Mars Cities are the largest in Solar System, they won their spot after catastrophic events of Dying Earth destroying most of what humanity has built through the history. Grande Olimp (Great Olympus) City surrounding mountain Olympus became capital city of MTR, which spans across entire mountain encircling it.</h3>

        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">During Colonisation era of Solar System, Previously knows as Russians, always dreamt to colonise the planet which USSR landed first on, Venera. Congress compared to UT, MTR, CS is young nation. Their ambitious project, Floating city “Novaya Venera” (New Venus), To this date, The City it still being constructed in above atmosphere of Venus. The Dream of making Venus habitable once again, always motived Vereyancev to reach their goal, Bombarding the planet to blow the clouds from surface and cool down the planet. Many do not share same views, Interstellar Cruisers provide them ability to settle on planets less melting than Venus.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Venusian Congress HQ “Novaya Venera” is considered Largest Atmospheric Station inside Solar System. One of their primary goals is to reveal secrets the crashed alien cruiser hides as by current.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Once Primary Stage of Novaya Venera will be finished, Congress will Deploy Hydrogen Filled Gigantic Balloons combined with Propulsion engines. Hydrogen Balloons will significantly decrease fuel usage by engines to keep city afloat. Venusian Congress will kill momentus and park city above clouds above alien ship. Slowly decreasing from orbit. </h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">All of this is huge Collaboration between Asteroid Belt (Ceres Shipyards), And Inner Planets
            Under the treaty between Venusian Congress, United Terra and Martian Technocratic Republic, the Alien artefacts can be researched and reverse engineered by all 3 Sides.
            Venusian Congress holds the right to store the database downloaded from Alien Ship for further decryption attempt and analysis.
