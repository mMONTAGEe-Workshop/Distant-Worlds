        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Earth was dying, with each passing year our blue planet, Earth, was becoming less habitable for humanity, in certain regions events frequency was increasing, the soil which was feeding us wasnâ€™t capable of giving us food anymore. Catastrophic heat was rising, Middle East became hell on Earth, people from Asias were migrating because of dying soil. Goverments of Earth, Collectively agreed for own safety unite under one Government, United Nations.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">After Solar System Colonisation Era, When humans settled on Moon, Mars and Outer Planets. United Nations was renamed to United Terra, Representatives of Earth-Moon System. UT decided to move their headquarters to Moon, because of Dying Earth. </h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">In the current year, United LunaTerra boasts the largest fleet in the Solar System. Certain regions on Earth have managed to preserve their natural beauty, with forests still flourishing and the soil supporting extensive farms. These areas are the primary agricultural providers, supplying food to both exoplanets and the entire Solar System.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Beyond their agricultural dominance, United LunaTerra holds significant shares in the Ceres Shipyards. They commission the construction of Garden Harvester megaships and various civilian vessels, further solidifying their influence in the Solar System's economy and infrastructure.</h3>
        <h3 id="infoboxdesc">Alien artifacts discovered on Venus, including an engine of unknown specifications, revolutionized human space exploration. United LunaTerra, in collaboration with Ceres Shipyards, reverse-engineered this enigmatic engine, unveiling a new era of interstellar travel. The groundbreaking engine, invented by Mark Cooper, operates by "lifting" a ship through AdS (Anti-De-Sitter space) into the 5th dimension from our four-dimensional space. This advanced technology allows for travel through curved geometry, dramatically contracting distances and making interstellar journeys feasible.</h3>
